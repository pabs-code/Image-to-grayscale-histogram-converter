## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-to-grayscale-converter.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pillow matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd image-to-grayscale-converter
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Upload an image file (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`) through the interface.

3. The app will:
   - Display the original image.
   - Convert it to grayscale.
   - Generate and show a histogram of pixel intensities.
